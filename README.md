\\\\\5 topics I find interesting\\\\\
1. I feel like it's almost mandatory at this point to mention AI
2. encryption, cryptology has always been something I enjoy, especially in relation to ARGs like cicada3301
3. game networking, I'd really like to learn the ins and outs of videogame servers.
4. peer-to-peer or lan, I remember hosting lan parties back in the day, I'd love to work with them again
5. I think it would be fun to set up a small iirc channel, that could be interesting to build.
\\\\\Challenging\\\\\
1. AI, from what I understand neural networks and learning algorithms are very complicated, or atleast I don't understand the math
2. I really don't have that much to put here, I'm sure I'll come across challenging things in this  class
